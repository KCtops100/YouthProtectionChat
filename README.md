# YouthProtectionChat Plugin

YouthProtectionChat is a Bukkit plugin that helps manage roles for players based on age categories, such as "youth" and "adult." This plugin provides commands for server operators to set roles for players, list players by role, and enforce chat restrictions for adult players when no other adults are online.

## Features

- **Role Management**: Assign players as "youth" or "adult."
- **Chat Restrictions**: Adults cannot chat unless another adult is online.
- **Command List**: 
  - `/setrole <player> <youth|adult>`: Set a playerâ€™s role.
  - `/listyouth`: List all youth players online.
  - `/listadults`: List all adult players online.
  - `/listnotassigned`: List players without an assigned role.
- **Tab Completion**: Supports tab completion for the `/setrole` command.

## Installation

1. Download the `YouthProtectionChat` plugin JAR file.
2. Place the JAR file in the `plugins` folder of your Bukkit/Spigot server.
3. Restart your server or reload the plugins.

## Usage
